# Project 2 - ios101-project2-wordle-starter

Submitted by: Christopher Meza

The wordle project 2 is a continuation of the first one. This time, we are working with optionals. For this project, we use optionals in the case if the value could be nil if there a value is absent. This new app has new features where we are able to change the settings of the game itself, like changing the number of guesses a user can attempt, the number of characters the word has, changing the theme of the word, or making the game difficult by toggling on Alien mode. The optional task, which includes adding the reset button, has been added.

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some of the challenges that i got from this project were the optionals themselves. Initially, learning how to what I had to do was tricky, but the tips were helpful. I implemented breakpoints in accessing the settings dictionary to learn more about what I was handling. The other difficulty was learning about the UIBarButton itself. Although, it was an easier challenge than the optinals excerises, but it took a bit learning about the button itself.
